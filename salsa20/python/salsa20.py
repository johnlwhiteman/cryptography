    Plaintext can be any size but works on 64-byte blocks of data.
    Key must be 16 bytes or 32 bytes. Other key sizes will fail here.
    Nonce is 8 bytes. Other nonce sizes will fail here. Keep your
    nonces randomly unique and you'll have no problems. The counter
    here refers to the block offset. This means that you can go
    directly to a given block by factor of 64 bytes. The default
    value is zero. There are no dependencies with the previous
    blocks. One can encrypt/decrypt starting anywhere within
    the length of the input. No checks are made if counter
    is greater than total 64-byte block size. All input
    values except the counter are Python bytes, not strings.
    Please see source examples in tests.py, client.py and
    sample.py to see how to properly call this function
    with the right data types. The counter is a simple
    integer of >= 0. One potential issue with this function
    is that the entire content is being stored in memory
    where ciphertext.extend() is being called. A better
    approach would be to use a python generator with yield
